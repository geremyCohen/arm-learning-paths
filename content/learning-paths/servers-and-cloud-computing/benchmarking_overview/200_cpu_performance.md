## Benchmarking CPU Performance

200 CPU Performance will be about “how much work” the cores are doing (IPC/CPI, ops/sec, turbo behavior, latencies vs. throughput). It will use tools like `perf` or `stress-ng --metrics-brief` to show actual instructions executed or cycles per instruction, and discuss microarchitectural factors.

Raw CPU performance measures the amount of computational work a processor can perform per unit time, independent of how busy its cores are. In this chapter, we explore key performance metrics, measurement methodologies, and factors that influence single-thread and multi-thread throughput.

### Why CPU Performance Matters

TODO: Introduce the distinction between utilization and performance, and explain why measuring raw performance (IPC, cycles/sec) is critical for workload sizing and architecture comparison.

### Key Performance Metrics

- **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)**: Average number of CPU instructions executed per clock cycle.
- **Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)**: Inverse of IPC, indicating pipeline efficiency.
- **Clock Frequency**: Processor operating speed (MHz/GHz) and its impact on throughput.
- **Operations Per Second**: Wall-clock throughput for a given workload (e.g., stress-ng ops/s).
- **Latency vs. Throughput**: Trade-offs between single-operation latency and overall throughput.

### Measurement Tools and Methodologies

TODO: Describe tools (e.g., `perf`, `pmu`, `stress-ng --metrics-brief`, custom microbenchmarks) and test patterns (fixed instruction count, fixed time window).

### Example: Single-Thread Throughput

TODO: Provide a simple example using `perf stat` or stress-ng with a known operation count, and show how to calculate ops/sec and IPC.

### Example: Multi-Thread Scaling

TODO: Show scaling curves for 1→N threads, plotting throughput vs. thread count, and discuss sub-linear scaling factors (memory bandwidth, contention).

### Factors Affecting CPU Performance

- **Microarchitectural Features**: Pipeline depth, branch prediction, execution units.
- **Turbo/Boost Technology**: Dynamic frequency scaling under load.
- **Cache Hierarchy and Bandwidth**: Impact of cache latencies and sizes.
- **Memory Subsystem**: DRAM frequency, NUMA effects.
- **Thermal and Power Limits**: Throttling under sustained high load.

## Next Steps

- Fill in the TODO sections with detailed methodology and real-world examples.
- Integrate charts and data from the CPU benchmark scripts.
