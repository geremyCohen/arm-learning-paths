## Understanding Energy Efficiency Under Different Workloads

Energy efficiency in computing refers to the amount of useful work a system can perform per unit of energy consumed. While our earlier chapter on power efficiency provided a general overview, this chapter focuses specifically on how energy efficiency varies across different types of workloads and how architectural differences between Intel/AMD (x86) and Arm can lead to significant variations in energy consumption patterns.

Different workloads stress different parts of the processor and system, resulting in varying power consumption profiles. Understanding these patterns is crucial for optimizing both performance and energy costs, especially in large-scale deployments where energy expenses can be substantial.

## Benchmarking Exercise

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Completed the repository setup from the previous chapter
- Two Ubuntu systems with the bench_guide repository cloned

### Step 1: Navigate to Directory

Navigate to the benchmark directory:

```bash
cd bench_guide/energy_efficiency
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Run the Benchmark

Execute the benchmark:

```bash
./benchmark.sh
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Results

Compare the results from both architectures, focusing on the key performance metrics displayed by the benchmark.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Completed the repository setup from the previous chapter
- Two Ubuntu systems with the bench_guide repository cloned

### Step 1: Navigate to Directory

Navigate to the benchmark directory:

```bash
cd bench_guide/energy_efficiency
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Run the Benchmark

Execute the benchmark:

```bash
./benchmark.sh
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Results

Ensure you have two Ubuntu VMs:
- One running on Intel/AMD (x86_64)
- One running on Arm (aarch64)

Both should have similar specifications for fair comparison.

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

Run the following commands on both VMs:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential stress-ng cpupower-utils linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic python3-matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Create Workload Scripts

Create a file named `cpu_workload.c` with the following content:

### Step 4: Run the Benchmark

Execute the benchmark script on both VMs:

```bash
sudo ./measure_energy.sh
```

### Step 5: Analyze the Results

Compare the results from both architectures, focusing on:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Compare operations per joule across different workloads.
2. **Workload Sensitivity**: Identify which workloads show the largest efficiency differences between architectures.
3. **Power Scaling**: Compare how power consumption scales with different types of work.
4. **Performance per Watt**: Compare the computational efficiency for each workload type.

### Interpretation

When analyzing the results, consider these architecture-specific factors:

- **Power Management Features**: Different approaches to power states, frequency scaling, and core gating.
- **Microarchitectural Efficiency**: How efficiently each architecture executes different instruction types.
- **Memory Subsystem**: Power efficiency of the memory hierarchy under different access patterns.
- **Idle Power**: Baseline power consumption when parts of the processor are idle.

## Arm-specific Optimizations

Arm architectures are known for their energy efficiency. Here are specific optimizations to further improve energy efficiency on Arm systems:

### 1. Arm big.LITTLE and DynamIQ Aware Scheduling

Create a file named `arm_cpu_affinity.c`:

Compile with:

```bash
gcc -O3 -pthread arm_cpu_affinity.c -o arm_cpu_affinity
```

### 2. Arm-optimized Power Management

Create a file named `arm_power_modes.c`:

Compile with:

```bash
gcc -O3 arm_power_modes.c -o arm_power_modes
```

### 3. Key Arm Energy Efficiency Optimization Techniques

1. **big.LITTLE and DynamIQ Awareness**: Schedule workloads appropriately:
   - Compute-intensive tasks on big cores
   - Background/lightweight tasks on LITTLE cores
   - Use `sched_setaffinity()` to control placement

2. **Arm-specific Power States**: Design applications to take advantage of Arm's power states:
   - Group computations into bursts to allow deeper sleep states
   - Use the `schedutil` CPU governor on Linux
   - Consider setting CPU affinity to avoid unnecessary core wake-ups

3. **Memory Access Optimization**: Optimize memory access patterns for energy efficiency:
   ```c
   // Instead of random access
   for (int i = 0; i < size; i += stride) {
       data[i] = process(data[i]);
   }
   
   // Use sequential access
   for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
       data[i] = process(data[i]);
   }
   ```

4. **Compiler Flags for Energy Efficiency**:
   ```bash
   gcc -O3 -march=native -mtune=native -fomit-frame-pointer
   ```

5. **Arm-specific Libraries**: Use optimized libraries:
   - Arm Compute Library for ML/computer vision
   - Arm Performance Libraries for math operations
   - Arm-optimized versions of common libraries (BLAS, LAPACK, etc.)

6. **DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) Optimization**:
   ```c
   // For compute-intensive sections
   system("echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor");
   
   // Heavy computation here
   
   // For idle/light sections
   system("echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor");
   ```

These optimizations can significantly improve energy efficiency on Arm architectures, especially for mobile, edge, and server workloads.

## Relevance to Workloads

Energy efficiency benchmarking across different workloads is particularly important for:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Optimizing workload placement for energy efficiency
2. **Data Centers**: Managing power and cooling costs
3. **Edge Computing**: Maximizing battery life or operating within power constraints
4. **High-Performance Computing**: Balancing performance and energy consumption
5. **Mobile and Embedded Systems**: Extending battery life under varying workloads

Understanding energy efficiency differences between architectures helps you:
- Select the optimal architecture for specific workload types
- Schedule workloads to maximize energy efficiency
- Design applications to minimize energy consumption
- Make informed decisions about hardware procurement based on expected workloads

## Advanced Analysis: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)

For a deeper understanding of energy efficiency, you can analyze how each architecture responds to DVFS:

```bash
# On systems with cpupower
for freq in $(cpupower frequency-info -l | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1, $2}'); do
  sudo cpupower frequency-set -f $freq
  # Run a benchmark at this frequency
  # Measure power consumption
done
```

This can reveal how efficiently each architecture scales performance with power.
