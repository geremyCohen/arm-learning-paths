title: Add Arm nodes to your Azure Kubernetes Services cluster using a multi-architecture nginx container image 

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is for developers who want to compare the performance of x64 and arm64 deployments by running nginx on a hybrid Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using nginx's multi-architecture container image.  Once you've seen how easy it is to add arm64 nodes to an existing cluster, you'll be ready to explore arm64-based nodes for other workloads in your environment.


learning_objectives:
  - Create a hybrid AKS cluster with x64 and arm64 nodes.
  - Deploy nginx's multi-architecture container image, pods, and services to the AKS cluster. 
  - Smoke test nginx from each architecture in the cluster to verify proper installation.
  - Performance test against each architecture in the cluster to better understand performance.
  

prerequisites:
    - An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
    - A local machine with [Azure CLI](/install-guides/azure-cli/) and [kubectl](/install-guides/kubectl/) installed.
