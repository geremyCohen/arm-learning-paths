## Test utility script

Now that you have your Intel nginx deployment running, you'll create a utility script to test and manage your nginx services across all architectures. This script will be used throughout the tutorial to test services, apply configurations, and access pods.

### Script functionality

The `nginx_util.sh` script provides three main functions:

- **`get intel|amd|arm|multiarch`** - Test nginx services and show which pod served the request
- **`put config`** - Apply performance-optimized nginx configuration and install btop monitoring tool
- **`login intel|amd|arm`** - Interactive bash access to architecture-specific pods

### Create the utility script

1. Copy and paste the following command to download and set up the `nginx_util.sh` script:

```bash
curl -o nginx_util.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geremyCohen/nginxOnAKS/refs/heads/main/nginx_util.sh
chmod +x nginx_util.sh
```

{{% notice Note %}}
This script supports all architectures (intel, arm, amd, multiarch) and will be used throughout the tutorial. You only need to create it once.

The script conveniently bundles test and logging commands into a single place, making it easy to test, troubleshoot, and view services.

You can now use this utility script throughout the tutorial to test services, apply configurations, and access pods across all architectures.
