## Test utility script

Now that you have your Intel nginx deployment running, you'll create a utility script to test and manage your nginx services across all architectures. This script will be used throughout the tutorial to test services, apply configurations, and access pods.

### Script functionality

The `nginx_util.sh` script provides three main functions:

- **`get intel|arm|multiarch`** - Test nginx services and show which pod served the request
- **`put config`** - Apply performance-optimized nginx configuration and install btop monitoring tool
- **`login intel|amd|arm`** - Interactive bash access to architecture-specific pods

The script conveniently bundles test and logging commands into a single place, making it easy to test, troubleshoot, and view services. You'll use it throughout the tutorial to test services, apply configurations, and access pods across all architectures.


### Create the utility script

{{% notice Note %}}
The following utility `nginx_util.sh` is provided for convenience. 

It's a wrapper for kubectl and other commands, utilizing [curl](https://curl.se/).  Make sure you have curl installed before running.
{{% /notice %}}

Copy and paste the following command into a terminal to download and create the `nginx_util.sh` script:

```bash
curl -o nginx_util.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geremyCohen/nginxOnAKS/refs/heads/main/nginx_util.sh
chmod +x nginx_util.sh
```

In the folder you ran the curl command, you should now see the `nginx_util.sh` script. Test it by running:

```bash
./nginx_util.sh
```

The output should include usage instructions:
```output
Invalid first argument. Use 'get', 'put', or 'login'.
```

With it working, you're now ready to deploy nginx to the Intel nodes in the cluster.
