You now have a working *fastpath* environment consisting of:

- A reusable *fastpath* host with the CLI, helper scripts, and kernel artifacts.
- A configured SUT that can receive new kernels and run the benchmark plan.
- A repeatable workflow for generating plans, executing tests, and analyzing results.

Continue exploring by revisiting the source documentation:

- [*fastpath* documentation](https://fastpath.docs.arm.com/en/latest/index.html) for advanced deployment models, additional benchmarks, and troubleshooting tips.
- [Kernel Install Guide](/install-guides/kernel-build/) for deeper dives into kernel customization, *fastpath* tagging, and artifact management.
- [Tuxmake documentation](https://docs.tuxmake.org/en/latest/) to learn how to tailor build matrices, cross-compilation targets, and caching strategies that complement the *fastpath* workflow.

Extend this learning path by experimenting with new kernel patches, expanding the benchmark suite, or automating the instance lifecycle with Terraform.
