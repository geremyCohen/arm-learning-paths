### Conclusion

Automating native builds for different architectures using Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines on Red Hat OpenShift 4.18 on AWS streamlines the development and deployment of versatile applications. By setting up distinct pipelines that leverage nodeSelector to build on x86\_64 and Arm64 nodes, you ensure that your application components are optimized for their target environments. This approach provides a clear and manageable way to embrace multi-architecture computing in the cloud.
